# Gegen // Ãœber

Who is actually my counterpart? And who am I?
What happens when two strangers ask each other the same question?
And in a simultaneity that would not be possible in spoken conversation?
Could foreign memories lead me to my own, long forgotten ones?

## Implementation

A basic NodeJs app using socket.io to facilitate drawing together while being apart.
The code base is very specific to the initial installation at Potsdamer Str. Berlin,
feel free to read, take, remix and contact us for questions on how to run and modify.
